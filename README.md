This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project to apply the skills I am learning on this
Full-stack technology. It is my first e-commerce store and it relies on Next.js, Prisma, Strip
and Tailwind.

This project was meant to be only for knowledge development and can't be considered Production
ready.

I leave you with some screenshots of the developed pages and emails:
